      More and more frequently it seems, mass shootings are accompanied by some kind of &quot;manifesto.&quot; This is hardly a new phenomenon&mdash;Ted Kaczynski&apos;s and Timothy McVeigh&apos;s far-right manifestos still loom large in the collective imagination (alongside the carnage these documents were meant to justify, of course.)
<br></br>
If you&apos;ve ever taken the time to read one of these screeds&mdash;be it Kaczynski&apos;s &quot;Industrial Society and its Future&quot; or the more recent examples penned by the Christchurch, El Paso, and Buffalo shooters&mdash;any air of gravitas around these documents quickly melts away. Not only do they tend to be poorly written and reasoned, but the content is hardly groundbreaking. Kaczynski and Tarrant (Christchurch) both regurgitate far-right arguments  and talking points that most audiences have encountered countless times before. In the age of the internet, plenty of people write strikingly similar things and have no problem disseminating them without killing anyone.
<br></br>
If you&apos;re like me, your morbid curiosity about documents like these surpasses how they are typically handled by news sites: an acknowledgement of their existence and a one-or-two sentence summary of the content. Certainly, there is plenty more to learn here. Many people more qualified than me <a href="https://schoolshooters.info/articles/general-research">have analyzed</a> collections of killers&apos; writing to, for example, create psychological profiles. There&apos;s also <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20503032211044426">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.icct.nl/app/uploads/2020/03/Jaocb-Ware-Terrorist-Manifestos2.pdf">research</a> on the function manifestos like these serve in extremist internet communities in coordinating and mythologizing attacks.
<br></br>
What I want to show here, instead, is a concise birds-eye view of how these documents relate to one another, and some macro trends. After scouring the internet for over 50 different pieces of writing from high-profile mass killers, I put together what I think is an informative way to organize and categorize these documents (and thus, their writers.)
<br></br>
We&apos;ll start with some simple descriptive stats and then dig deeper:


<br></br>
<br></br>
  </div>
    <div id='sections'>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">This analysis includes 51 of documents,</div>
        each written by a mass-murderer or (or attempted mass-murderer). This is not a representative sample of all mass killers, as typically
         documents like these are only available for highest-profile cases.
        <!-- <br><br> -->
        <!-- <div class="note">* There were actually approx. 1317 passengers on board but this is the total in the data.</div> -->
      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The vast majority of these cases involve the use of firearms.</div>

        Most of these documents are from the US, where high-profile mass shootings are shamefully common.

      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">20 of the documents are <q>manifestos*</q> or screeds.</div>
          These are documents a killer published, or attempted to publish, in order to justify or explain their actions. The rest are journal entries, suicide notes, or other writing like online posts.
      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">&quot;Manifestos&quot; tend be wordier than the other document types.</div>



      </section>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">And they also tend to have more complex writing.</div>
        Compared to other documents in the corpus of similar length, <q>manifestos</q> tend to have a higher flesch-kincaid grade level (a common measure of writing complexity).
      </section>

      <section class="step">

        <div class="title">Now, let&apos;s look at the contents.</div>
        This arrangement of points shows, in two dimensions*, how similar the documents are to one another, based on common word usage. Closer points represent documents which use many of the same words.
<div class="note">*This with Doc2Vec & UMAP. There&apos;s more detail on this below. </div>
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <br></br>
        <div class="title">For example, </div>
        Ted Kaczynski&apos;s anti-liberal <q>Industrial Society and its Future</q> is quite similar in content to the 450,000 word racist screed written by Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people and wounded hundreds of others in the 2011 Norway Attacks.

      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Similarly,</div>
        The writings of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine school shooters, are quite similar to one another, but are less related to those of Kaczynski or Breivik.

      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">This view reveals two clusters:</div>
        The first largely consists of far-right screeds rationalizing their writers&apos; actions. Here you will find Christchurch, Buffalo, El Paso, Charleston, as well as other murders motivated by racism, antisemitism, or islamaphobia.

      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">A subset of this first group focuses exclusively on elucidating far-right political ideals. </div>
         These documents are largely bereft of personal experience or emotion.
         In addition to  Kaczynski or Breivik, this group includes Brenton Harrison Tarrant (Christchurch 2019) and Payton S. Gendron (Buffalo 2022).

       Many killers are inspired by others. As such, many of the documents contain explicit references to other mass killers. This network illustrates those reference linkages. Columbine is central to the grievance/nihilism cluster.  Christchurch is central to the racism/antisemitism cluster.

      <b>This &quot;Columbine&quot;/&quot;Christchurch&quot; two-type classification of mass killers seems apt</b>, but
it&apos;s worth emphasizing that the relationship between these two classifications is not completely clean-cut. As the network graph shows, these two traditions have evolved together&mdash;you can follow the chain of references from Buffalo back to Columbine.
<br></br>
<div class="title"><b>Some noteworthy exceptions:</b></div>
There is also not such a clean divide in the content of these documents as the visualizations may suggest. For example, there is plenty of racism to be found in the nihilistic/grievance group: Eric Harris (Columbine) made many deferential references to Nazis throughout his journal, and even liked to pepper in German phrases. Harris wrote despicable things about gays, Jewish people, Black people, and women. But in contrast with many of the other hard-right killers, he seemed to revere the Nazis primarily for their capacity for mass cruelty itself, rather than any specific political ideas.
  <br></br>
        <div class="docquote">
          <q>If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a &quot;final solution&quot; to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven&apos;t figured it out yet, I say &quot;KILL MANKIND.&quot; No one should  survive.
</q>
        </div>
        <div class="quoteattr">
Eric Harris
        </div>
<br></br>
Contrast this with the way the Great Replacement-motivated killers self-conceptualize as part of a grand historical struggle; their actions, they believe, will seem rational to those who are willing to accept the &quot;truth&quot; about race relations.
<br></br>
Many other killers seemed to connect with Harris&apos;s particular brand of nihilism&mdash;no other specific figure in the collection of texts was referenced by name more frequently. Randy Stair and Alvaro Castillo, in particular, write about Harris like a hero and cite him as an inspiration for what they eventually did.
<br></br>
There are other exceptions in the other group (characterized above as racist rationalizers) as well. For example, Christopher Dorner, who killed 5 and injured 6 in a series of shootings in California targeting law enforcement, wrote impersonally about how he was motivated to kill police officers in order to correct problems he saw in how the LAPD interacted with the community, particularly along racial lines. Still racially motivated, but hardly white supremacist.
<br></br>
        <div class="docquote">
          <q>I am here to change and make policy. The culture of LAPD versus the community and honest/good officers needs to and will change. I am here to correct and calibrate your morale compasses to true north.</q>
        </div>
        <div class="quoteattr">
          Christopher Dorner
        </div>


<br></br>
There&apos;s also James Holmes, who killed 12 and injured 70 in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting. Holmes&apos; writing is categorized in the rationalizer group, but primarily due to style rather than content. He wrote dispassionately, but about himself&mdash;adopting the tone of a professional taking notes on a subject.
<br></br>

        <div class="docquote">
          <q>Self Diagnosis of a Broken Mind
Dysphoric Mania. Generalized anxiety disorder/ social anxiety disorder  /OCD / PTSD (chronic)/ Asperger syndrome / autism. ADHD. Schizophrenia. Body dysmorphic disorder. Borderline, narcissistic, anxious, avoidant and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. Chronic insomnia. Psychosis. Trichotillomania. Adjustment disorder. Pain disorder. Restless leg syndrome.</q>
        </div>
        <div class="quoteattr">
          James Holmes
        </div>

<br></br>
While Holmes&apos; self-studying tone is unique, many other killers make specific references to mental health disorders&mdash;some self-diagnosed, but others not. And a recurring topic in several texts is the ineffectiveness of the treatment (often medication) they were receiving. That&apos;s perhaps a direction to explore more in the future.
<br></br>
<div class="title"><b>Some other things:</b></div>
As a side note, in the aftermath of Columbine, Marilyn Manson&apos;s music was often speculated to be a potential inspiration of the attack, as Harris and Klebold&apos;s journals contain many references to Manson&apos;s music. Out of curiosity, I took the lyrics from Manson&apos;s 1996 album Antichrist Superstar to see where they&apos;d land. To be sure, they fell firmly in the nihilist cluster, but not particularly close to Harris and/or Klebold&mdash;there is no exceptional similarity.
<br></br>
One more thing to note with respect to the network graph is the extent to which certain killers valorized others. In particular,  Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook) was noteworthy in the sheer volume of references he made to other killers. He references nine other killers included in this analysis, and many, many others who were not. Lanza&apos;s obsessions with other killers is <a href="https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/role_model_fame_seeking_1.0.pdf">well documented</a>: He created a massive spreadsheet containing minute details on five hundred killers. He also edited Wikipedia entries on various killers, typically adding details regarding the firearms they used.
<br></br>
There&apos;s a widely shared <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/15/1099014432/why-npr-isnt-using-the-word-manifesto
"> article from npr</a> that argues that we shouldn&apos;t use the word &quot;manifesto&quot; to describe documents like these since doing so &quot;may elevate&quot; the racist content, &quot;in the eyes of those who might want to copy this person&apos;s actions, to something more than it might really have been.&quot; I tried to be mindful of this when using this word by couching it in quotes, but chose not to avoid it completely&mdash;I think doing so would lead to confusion since this is the word most people are familiar with. Similarly, <a href="https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/dont_name_them_1.1.pdf"> others have pointed out </a>that even using killers&apos; names may &quot;gives many of them what they want, encourages future fame-seeking offenders, and appears to increase the likelihood of contagion and copycat effects.&quot; But I felt that this too was unavoidable without causing confusion.
<br></br>
<div class="title"><b>More detail on the clustering methodology:</b></div>
Looking at these types of charts, people often ask what the x and y axes represent. It&apos;s a bit unintuitive since they don&apos;t represent anything specific about the content by themselves. The original embeddings, generated with doc2vec, had a vector size of 20. To scale this down to just 2 dimensions for presentation, I used an algorithm called UMAP ( Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). For more information on how either of algorithms work, see <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-doc2vec-logistic-regression-9da9947b43f4"> here</a> for documentation on doc2vec or <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> here</a> for UMAP.
